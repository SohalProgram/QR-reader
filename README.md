QR code reader code In addition, an exe file of the code is attached.

This code uses the OpenCV library and the Pyzbar library to detect and decode QR codes from a video stream captured by the computer's camera. The 'decoder' function takes an image as input, converts it to grayscale, and uses the 'decode' function from Pyzbar to detect any QR codes in the image. For each QR code detected, the code draws a polyline around the code's boundaries, displays the code's data and type on the image, and prints the code's data and type to the console. Finally, the code uses the cv2.VideoCapture() function to start capturing video from the computer's camera, and in a while loop, it calls the 'decoder' function on each frame of the video, displays the image with the decoded QR code information on the screen, and exits the loop if the user presses the 'q' key. This version of code doesn't check for a specific code or print anything.

The use of this code is free.
